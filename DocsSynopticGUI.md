# Synoptic Graphical Alternatives #

Synoptic supports two kinds of graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
  * [GWT-based GUI](DocsWebAppTutorial.md)
  * [Swing-based GUI](SwingGUI.md)

The GWT-based GUI is under active development and is recommended for users who want to use a Synoptic GUI. Consult the pages linked above for more information.

Below are two screenshots that give an idea of how the two GUIs look.
